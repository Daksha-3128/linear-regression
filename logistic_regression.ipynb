        "# Question 10: Imagine you are working at an e-commerce company that wants to predict which customers will respond to a marketing campaign. Given an imbalanced dataset (only 5% of customers respond), describe the approach you'd take to build a Logistic Regression model including data handling, feature scaling, balancing classes, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model for this real-world business use case.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a Logistic Regression model for predicting customer responses in an imbalanced dataset, the following approach can be taken:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Collect and clean customer data (e.g., demographics, past purchases, browsing behavior).\n",
        "\n",
        "Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove irrelevant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Feature Scaling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Apply standardization (z-score scaling) so that all features are on the same scale, ensuring Logistic Regression coefficients are stable and interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Balancing Classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Since only 5% of customers respond, the dataset is highly imbalanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), undersampling, or class weights (penalty='balanced') in Logistic Regression to ensure the model does not always predict the majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters like C (regularization strength) and penalty (L1 or L2).\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps avoid overfitting and improves generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Model Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy is not a good metric in imbalanced data (predicting all customers as \"no\" would give ~95% accuracy).\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, use metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this business case, Recall (Sensitivity) is very important (to capture as many potential responders as possible), but Precision is also relevant (to avoid wasting marketing budget on uninterested customers)."
